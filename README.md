ProjectBlackGrid

This is the public repo for my strategy game project currently titled BlackGrid being developed in Unity.

BlackGrid is a 2D top down grid based strategy game. The premise of the game is that hacking technology in the future has advanced to the point that hackers have become dangerous criminals with the potential to cause disaster on a global scale. Smart programs have been developed that use advanced algorithms to exploit vulnerabilities in security software and steal sensitive data from corporations and governments. Cybersecurity firms have risen become the most powerful political entities on the planet and use their economic and political power to keep the civilian population under their control. The player takes the control of an disgruntled agent of one of these cybersecurity firms.

Players purchase "programs" and place them on the map grid to do battle against opposing programs. Programs expand as they move across the grid so that a single program can occupy multiple tiles on the grid. There is no Health, programs destroy each other by using abilities that remove other programs' tiles. Special programs exist that can remove or add tiles onto the grid or affect the movement and attack of other units, creating interesting position based gameplay that requires effective intuition and strategy for success.

Further information about the game to come soon...
